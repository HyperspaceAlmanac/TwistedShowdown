# The theme of the contest is "Twist," and this game does that both visually and thematically.
The gameplay is a twist of the classic trope of slaying monsters, where now the player's goal is to free them from their magical prisons.

The player has access to triple swords, ice magic orb, and special healing abilities that cost health.

## Key Features:
Lock on system that changes the reticle baed on what the player is aiming at.

Flashy animations for the weapon attacks.

Single and 4 player missions that displays the objectives and spawns targets for the player to destory and dangers to avoid.

Multiple phase missions.

Persistent progression system where players can earn gold and upgrade their gear.
